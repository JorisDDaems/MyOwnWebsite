                <h3>About myself</h3>

                <p>
                    Born one day after Jesus. Grew up as the youngest of five brothers playing football, reading comic books, and going to the boyscouts. 
                    Went to Canada when I was seven. Always wanted a dog, but got a rabbit instead. Studied ancient Latin, became leader in the boy scouts,
                    Graduated as an Academic Bachelor Social Work at Artesis Plantijn University College. Worked as a taxi dispatcher for terminally ill people,
                    and swam three kilometers for a good cause. Worked at a discotheek, and won the belgian indoor frisbee tournament two times in a row. Changed jobs 
                    and started working as a social worker to help students in need at the VCLB. After two years I moved to Lugano, Switzerland to work as an au pair for Ella and Tzarek the dog.
                    Came back to Belgium after this assignment and started coding at Intec Brussels. Changed fields to have more opportunities for growth and job security. 
                    Survived a global pandemic until now (**knocking on wood**) and learned how to code during this time.
